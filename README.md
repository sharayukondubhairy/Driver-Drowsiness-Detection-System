# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
The System uses Haar Cascade classifiers and machine learning to monitor a driver's alertness. It detects a driver's face and eyes in real-time, analyzing eye state (open or closed). If eye blink duration exceeds a set threshold, an alert is triggered for potential drowsiness.
